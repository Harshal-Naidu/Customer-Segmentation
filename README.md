# Overview:
This project focuses on customer segmentation using mall customer data obtain from Kaggel. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on certain characteristics such as demographics, behavior, or preferences. By understanding different segments of customers, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to better meet the needs of each group.In this project, we analyze mall customer data containing information such as customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score. Using this data, we aim to identify distinct customer segments and derive insights to inform business decisions.

# Data Description:
The dataset contains the following columns:
1. Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
3. Age: Age of the customer.
4. Annual Income: Annual income of the customer in dollars.
5. Spending Score: Spending score assigned to the customer based on their behavior and purchasing data.

# Project Goals:
1. Segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics.
2. Analyze the characteristics of each segment to understand their preferences and behavior.
3. Provide insights and recommendations to the business based on the segmentation analysis.

# Project Structure:
The project is structured as follows:
1. Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution of variables.
2. Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Customer Segmentation: Implementation of segmentation algorithms such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering to group customers based on similarities.
4. Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of the resulting segments to identify key characteristics and behaviors of each group.
5. Visualization: Visual representation of the segmentation results using plots and charts to facilitate understanding and decision-making.
6. Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarization of findings and actionable recommendations for the business.
